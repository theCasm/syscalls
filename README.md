# A metric ton of linux syscalls  
Exactly what it sounds like. I've tried to keep them commented
enough to be somewhat understood, given that assembly is the way that it is.
## Why though?
 - assembly practice
 - unix-style systems are prevalent for a reason, it's good to know how their user-kernal interface works.
 - doing is understanding, and I'd like to understand how "nicer" interfaces like the C standard library work
