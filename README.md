# A fuck ton of linux syscalls  
Exactly what it sounds like. I've tried to keep them commented
enough to be easily understood, so they could be used as an example.  
## Why though?  
As much of a humble and selfless individual as I am, I am not doing this
as a tutorial for others. I personally enjoy linux as a development platoform,
and so I think that understanding it's syscalls and doing my best to sift through
it's kernel could be very useful experience
